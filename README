This is a training project for me.

Key things you can do here:

--== Playwright ==--
UI tests are stored: src/tests/ui_functional/blogs/*
API tests are stored: src/tests/api/*

1) Launch Playwright UI tests via command:
  $npm run test:chromium
2) Launch Playwright "API" tests via command:
  $npm run test:api
3) Check Playwright tests report command:
  $npm run test:report
4) To run Linter (with fix):
  $npm run lint:ts
  $npm run lint-fix:ts

--== K6 ==--
Tests are stored: src/tests/k6_performance/*.spec.ts

For Grafana/Influxdb report, you need to launch:
  $docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d

To launch K6 test and write result to db run script from terminal under k6_performance folder:
  pavlo@Pavlo-PC k6_performance % k6 run --out influxdb=http://localhost:8086/db0 get_k6.spec.ts
  ÃŸ
--out influxdb=http://localhost:8086/db0 - it's for result been written into influxdb
Just run test, without db: 
  $k6 run get_k6.spec.ts

To open Dashboard go to:
http://localhost:3000/d/ReuNR5Aik/k6-dashboard?orgId=1


Some notes:
- executed to remove error "Cannot find module 'k6' or its corresponding type declarations."
  $npm install --save @types/k6
